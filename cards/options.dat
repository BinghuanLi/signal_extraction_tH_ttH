## How to do?
blinded         = True
blindedOutput   = False ## do not draw the rate on the impacts plot
sendToCondor    = False ## Impacts / GOF / likelihood scans for combo need it
sendToLXBatch   = False ## the mu's result retrieval are not working in condor -- but they work with lxbatch

## What to do:
#######################
## Each of the steps bellow take time, I suggest to do on one separated runs
# (like this, they can be also done in parallel)

# 0) Combo results
doWS                    = True ## To do any of the rest you must have ran with this being True once
doRateAndSignificance   = False
doLimits                = False
do2Dlikelihoods         = False

# 1) results by category
doCategoriesWS            = False ## To do any of the rest you must have ran with this being True once
doCategoriesLimitsFromMu1 = False
doCategoriesMu            = False
doCategoriesLimits        = False

# 2)
# for combo is almost mandatory send impacts calculation to grid, -- update instructions
# if you run on lxplus combineTool is already set to send to Condor (see bellow 'How')
doImpactCombo             = False
doImpact2017              = False
# If you will run in Condor this must be done in two steps:
#  -  the first with impactsSubmit= True ---> wait for the jobs to be ready
#      - To see that is all done: check that you have the same number of root files than the number of nuissances to be considered
#  - after the jobs are done run again with impactsSubmit = False to wrap up the plot
impactsSubmit = False

# 3) -- optional
# fast version of the impacts -- Hessian approximation for quick checks
doHessImpacts             = False
doImpactsNoSubmit         = False

# 4)
# the bellow take lots of time, better to do on one run
# It is almost mandatory send to grid,
# if you run on lxplus combineTool is already set to send to Condor (see bellow 'How')
doGOFCombo                = False
doGOF2017                 = False
# If you will run in Condor this must be done in two steps:
#  -  the first with GOF_submit = True ---> wait for the jobs to be ready
#     -- each job will contain 2 toys
#        (if needed run the submission bash script created again up to you be happy with the number of toys)
#  - after the jobs are done run again with GOF_submit = False  to wrap up the plot
GOF_submit = False

# 5)
# OR you do from Combine or from from Havester
preparePlotCombine  = False
preparePlotHavester = True
doPostFit           = False # if False do Prefit only, it True it does both
plainBins           = True # relevant only for the PlotHavester
doTablePrefit       = True

doYieldsAndPlots = False # will do the prefit and postfit table of yields.
# If any of the bellow are true it also do prefit and postfit plots
# You must have ran the respective preparePostFit... before (or put as true as well)
## the bellow is still deprecated
doPostFitCombine = False # doYieldsAndPlots must be true
doPostFitHavester = False # doYieldsAndPlots must be true

doRatesByLikScan        = False
doCategoriesMuAndLimits = False

## The bellow makes a fit on kt assuming SM kinematics all the way: useful to setups and checks
do_kt_scan_no_kin       = False
do2Dlikelihoods_with_tH = False ## Warning: it assumes SM kinematics for tH for all couplings, only for plots setup
